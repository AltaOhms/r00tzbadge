The 8 pin male header will be on the bottom of the LED Array.

Do not cut the legs off of any the headers. The long headers are used for the r00tz shield PCB.

![Stacking Shield](https://github.com/HelloTechie/r00tzbadge/blob/master/HookupGuide/StackingShield.jpg "How to stack the shield")

After all parts are soldered on the shield you can then stack the r00tz shield on top of the Redstick's headers. Place the LED array on the correct pins of the r00tz shield. The r00tz shield has white silkscreen that says "LED ARRAY." Follow that for placement guidance. In order for the badge to work, you must have the shield & LED Array stacked correctly and look like the photo below.
